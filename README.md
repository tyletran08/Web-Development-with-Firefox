# Web-Development-with-Firefox
### What is this?
This is a collection of resources for web development with Firefox. It is intended to be a companion to the [Mozilla Developer Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/), and to provide a more curated list of resources for web development with Firefox.

### What is the Mozilla Developer Network?
The Mozilla Developer Network (MDN) is a wiki-based resource for web developers. It is maintained by Mozilla, and is the best place to find documentation on web technologies. It is also the home of the [Web API reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API), which is the most comprehensive reference for web APIs.

### What is Firefox?
Firefox is a web browser developed by Mozilla. It is the second most popular web browser, and is the only major browser developed by a non-profit organization. Firefox is also the only major browser that is open source.

### Okay? Why do you have this repository?
I have this repository to keep track of my progess using Firefox's web development guide. I also want to share my progress with others and show what I have learned.
